How to play

Simply put token on the column by inputing number of the column.

The token will be 1 for player 1 and 2 for player 2.

The token will fall into the lowest level!

======================================================================================================

Rule of the game:

You need to get as many token as you can! the player with more token win!

If you put a token in the highest level the game end and start counting token.

You can eat other player token by putting your token in both side of the other player token.

======================================================================================================

Thats all for the rule!

Have Fun!
